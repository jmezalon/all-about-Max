            <p>Hey, welcome to my page. That's me on left trying to debug my code.</p>
            <p>I drove for Uber for over 5 years. I thought it was about time to switch career. I apply to a software engineering bootcamp in 2018 and started practicing web development.</p>
            <p>The job search phase was not easy; I stop searching for a while and started driving for uber again. However, because I am so passionate about being an engineer, I thought I would try again with the help of a new school, <a href="https://flatironschool.com/campus-and-online-coding-bootcamp/">Flatiron</a>  school for software engineering!</p>

            <p>I love technology at a very young age. Most of my money was spent on a wide variety of tech devices. I especially love the syncrynization of devices.</p>
            <p>That was very popular with apple devices. which is why I had apple laptop, phone and tablet.</p>
            <p>I didn't want to just keep using these technology which of course made my life a lot easier. I wanted to also help build these technology to improve the lives of others.</p>
            <p>That's why I chose software engineering!</p>

            <p>I want to get my first tech job within 2 to 3 months.</p>
            <p>In order for that goal to be a realization.  I will make sure during my time at Flatiron to practice as many algorithm as possible and be comfortable with all the data structures.</p>
            <p>I will work on different projects to have a solid porfolio. increase and build my network through different events as well as Linked In.</p>
