            <p>Hey, welcome to my page!</p>
            <p>I drove for Uber for over five years. I thought it was about time to switch careers. I applied to a software engineering boot camp in 2018 and started learning web development.</p>
            <p>The job search phase was not easy; I stopped searching and started driving for Uber again. However, because I am so passionate about being an engineer, I thought I would try again with the help of the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/campus-and-online-coding-bootcamp/">Flatiron</a>  school for software engineering!</p>

            <p>I loved technology at a very young age, and I've spent a lot of money on a wide variety of tech devices. I especially love the synchronization of devices which is very popular with Apple products; and this is why I had an Apple laptop, iPhone and iPad.</p>
            <p>These technologies made my life a lot easier. I also wanted to help build these technologies to improve the lives of others.</p>
            <p>That's why I chose software engineering!</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>I want to get my first tech job within 2 to 3 months.</p>
            <p>For that goal to be a realization, I will make sure to practice as many algorithms as possible and be comfortable with all the data structures during my time at Flatiron.</p>
            <p>I will work on different projects to have a solid porfolio and increase and build my network through various events and LinkedIn.</p>
            <p>Hopefully, I could start a new role at the beginning of next year with all of that in place!</p>

                <p>Group project built with a team of two within one week to showcase understanding of a basic full-stack app using sinatra and active record for the backend and react for the frontend.</p>
                <p>Worked extensively in most of the backend, and did some fetch request in the frontend such as creating, deleting and updating the notes and notebook.</p>
